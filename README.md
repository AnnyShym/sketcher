Getting to know OOP concepts

1. "Familiarization with OOP concepts: inheritance and type polymorphism (virtual methods)"
   Construct a class hierarchy for displaying graphic shapes: a segment, a rectangle, an ellipse, etc. - at least 6 figures.
   Distribute classes by modules. Create a list of shapes as a separate class.
   Add various shapes to the list in the main module of the program (static initialization) and then start drawing the list.

2. You can create shapes at the user interface level.
   Creating an object must be done so that adding a new class to the system does not require changing the existing code.
   The resulting program should be a primitive graphic editor.
